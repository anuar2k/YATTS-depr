# YATTS
Yet Another Trucking Telemetry Solution is a project focused on providing a user-friendly app letting the user to
select the game's telemetry values off the list, stream them through the Serial Port and generate Arduino-complaint code which would receive the data.

This app would be helpful for every trucking hobbyist who wants to make their own device utilising the telemetry data from the game.

This repository will contain also the source of the plugin for the ETS2/ATS in the future.
